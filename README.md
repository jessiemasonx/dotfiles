## Er is een welcome message toegevoegd en er voor gezorgd dat er een hartje voor m'n naam staat

# dotfiles

In the beginning I no idea what to do until I read the articles and askes people to help. Later when I started to understand it it became kind off fun. 

# Things I've done
1. Added a welcome message. "Hey flapdrol, this is your welcome message. Cool heüëåüèº"
2. Modified my prompt. Put a heart emoji in front of the base name. 
3. Added 1 alias: alias ll="ls -lhA". Got this from the article.
4. Added a readme which you're looking at right now.

This article I used a lot. I thought it was very helpful.  
When there was anything else I had to figure out I just looked it up on google.
